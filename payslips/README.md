# Payslips Tampermonkey Script

Sage HR supports downloading payslips as PDF, but no other format. This script is to be used with
[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to download individual payslips in QIF format.

## Installation

1. Install Tampermonkey for your browser.
2. Open the dashboard and click the Utilities tab.
3. In "Import from URL", enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmbuckley/finance/main/payslips/tampermonkey.js and click Install.

Now, when you view a payslip in Sage HR, there will be a "Download QIF" button at the top.
